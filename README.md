# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayush

I build **practical tools** using Python, Linux, and basic networking.  
My focus is automation, troubleshooting, and system-level problem solving.

Right now I’m sharpening my fundamentals in **cybersecurity and Linux internals** by building small but real projects instead of tutorial junk.

I’m targeting **entry-level IT / support / junior sysadmin roles** where hands-on skills actually matter.
